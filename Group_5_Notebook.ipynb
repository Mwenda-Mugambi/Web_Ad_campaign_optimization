    "The maximum value for 'Simulated_Users' reaching 110,612 is strikingly higher than the third quartile (Q3) of 15,208.25. This substantial difference strongly indicates the potential presence of outliers, particularly on the higher end of the distribution. Data points beyond the upper whisker of the boxplot for 'Simulated_Users' may be considered outliers, pointing to unusually high daily user counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, 'Simulated_New_Users' presents a maximum value of 117,086, which significantly surpasses the third quartile (Q3) of 9,550.75. This divergence between the maximum value and Q3 strongly suggests potential outliers on the higher end for new user counts. Data points beyond the upper whisker of the boxplot for 'Simulated_New_Users' may be indicative of unusually high daily values for new user acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification of these outliers, particularly on the higher end, raises concerns about the potential skewing of the distribution and subsequent impacts on our overall analysis. Furter investigation into the nature of these outliers and implementation of outlier-handling techniques is therefore crucial in ensuring the accuracy of our time series forecasts."

    "- On 16th April, 2018 Jambojet introduced a [72-hour special fare for 10,000 seats](https://www.financialfortunemedia.com/jambojet-slashes-fares-sh2200-new-move/), offering clients unprecedented one-way rates as low as KES 2,200 for domestic destinations and KES 7,330 to Entebbe, Uganda. This led to substantial spikes in web traffic, reaching the highest recorded values of 66,010 'Simulated_Users' and 61,576 'Simulated_New_Users' on 17th April 2018, 44,308 'Simulated_Users' and 39,061 'Simulated_New_Users' on 18th April 2018, and 34,532 'Simulated_Users' and 27,982 'Simulated_New_Users' on 19th April 2018.\n",

'Simulated_Users' totaled 37,441, and 'Simulated_New_Users' reached 30,246.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In February 2019, the airline marked the one-year anniversary of its route to Entebbe, Uganda, by introducing a special promotion offering a [25% discount on one-way tickets](https://www.jambojet.com/en-us/jambojet-one-year-anniversary-in-uganda/) for bookings during the month. This led to a notable increase in user activity on the website throughout the month, with 'Simulated_Users' fluctuating between 10,487 and 18,553 from the 4th to the 28th of February 2019. Similarly, 'Simulated_New_Users' showed a range of 6,603 to 14,798 during this period, reflecting the positive impact of the promotional offer on user engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To celebrate its fifth-year anniversary, on 1st April, 2019 Jambojet announced the [sale of 100 one-way tickets for KES 50 each](https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2019/04/jambojet-extends-sh50-ticket-offer-for-domestic-destinations/), extending the offer to an additional day on 5th April 2019. This resulted in increased traffic, with 28,390 total users and 21,052 new users on 1st April 2019 and 25,066 total users and 21,193 new users on 5th April 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On 25th November 2019, the airline initiated its flights to Kigali, Rwanda, resulting in a substantial surge in website traffic. On that specific day, 'Simulated_Users' experienced a notable increase, reaching 17,386, while 'Simulated_New_Users' rose to 11,255. This heightened level of activity persisted for the following three days, with 'Simulated_Users' maintaining a range of 16,812 to 15,791 and 'Simulated_New_Users' fluctuating between 9,166 and 11,271.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As part of the airline's 2020 New Year Celebrations, the announcement of [selling 10,000 tickets at Kes 2,020 from 2nd - 4th January 2020](https://nation.africa/kenya/business/jambojet-sells-tickets-for-sh2-020-237328) marked the highest-ever spike in website traffic. On 2nd January 2020, 'Simulated_Users' and 'Simulated_New_Users' reached 110,612 and 117,086, respectively. The heightened engagement continued on 3rd and 4th January 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On 5th January, 2021 a [72-hour sale offering 10,000 seats at a discounted rate of Kes 2,100](https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2021/01/jambojet-offering-passengers-10000-seats-at-sh2100/) for domestic flights to celebrate the new year  sparked a surge in web traffic. The campaign, running from 5th to 7th January 2021, successfully attracted a substantial number of visitors to the airline's website. On 5th January, 'Simulated_Users' peaked at 71,993, accompanied by 64,307 'Simulated_New_Users'. The momentum continued on 6th January with 43,090 'Simulated_Users' and 31,560 'Simulated_New_Users,' and on 7th January, the site recorded 47,408 'Simulated_Users' and 32,995 'Simulated_New_Users.'\n",
    "\n",
    "- [In collaboration with Cellulant, Jambojet unveiled a promotional campaign](https://www.jambojet.com/en-us/plan-your-trip/nowtravelready-discount-vouchers/), offering 50 vouchers at Kes 1,000 each day from November 16, 2021, to December 23, 2021. This initiative triggered a surge in 'Simulated_Users' on November 15, soaring to 18,636 from 14,003 the day before. Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' experienced an increase, reaching 12,229 from 10,286 on the previous day. Throughout the promotional period, the website consistently attracted traffic, with 'Simulated_Users' fluctuating between 12,250 and 22,460, and 'New_Simulated_Users' ranging from 6,981 to 15,273. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To celebrate flying over 1 million passengers in 2022, Jambojet announced the [sale of 1,000 tickets at Kes 1,000 for one-way domestic flights](https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/bd/corporate/companies/jambojet-woos-travellers-with-sh1-000-fare-in--4082138). This 24-hour promotion, starting on 10th January 2023, led to spikes in visitors, with 'Simulated_Users' and 'Simulated_New_Users' reaching 79,199 and 72,045 on 10th January and 42,155 and 31,058 on 11th January.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On June 14, 2022, Jambojet unveiled a new collaboration with Cellulant, this time [introducing an incentive program to reward over 600 frequent fliers](https://www.jambojet.com/en-us/about-jambojet/press-room/jambojet-cellulant-partner-to-award-over-600-frequent-fliers-with-over-2m-in-rewards/) with discount vouchers valued at Kes 3,000 each. These vouchers were exclusively available to customers enrolled in the Jambojet Rewards loyalty program. The announcement appeared to have sparked an increase in 'Simulated_Users,' surging to 17,318 from the previous day's 15,363, while 'New_Simulated_Users' rose to 11,713 from 9,083. From the announcement date until August 8, 2022, 'Simulated_Users' exhibited fluctuations within the range of 11,916 to 36,245, and 'New_Simulated_Users' fluctuated between 7,874 and 30,434. However it is worth noting that this increased web traffic can more likely be attributed to the gradual recovery of Kenya's tourism sector post-COVID.\n",

    "These examples highlight a consistent pattern where promotional events, offering special fares or discounts, correlate with substantial increases in web traffic. "

    "- In March 2020, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya prompted significant measures to curb the spread of the virus. On 15th March 2020, President Uhuru Kenyatta, along with Cabinet Secretary for Health Mutahi Kagwe, announced a series of restrictions. [Travel from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases was restricted](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/3/15/kenya-blocks-entry-for-non-residents-in-virus-response), only allowing entry to Kenyan citizens and foreigners with valid residence permits subject to self-quarantine or government-designated facilities. Schools and higher learning institutions were closed, remote work was encouraged, and essential services continued. Cashless transactions were promoted, and various gatherings were restricted, including weddings, malls, nightclubs, churches, and hospital visits. Cargo vessels, aircraft, or ships were permitted, subject to disinfection and crew quarantine.\n",

Additionally, a [suspension on international flights imposed](https://www.africanews.com/2020/03/23/kenya-suspends-all-international-flights-as-covid-19-cases-double//) effective from 25th March, causing a dampening effect on tourism. As the month progressed, cases continued to rise, and the first COVID-19-related death was reported on 26th March.\n",

    "- Before the announcements on 15th March 2020, Jambojet's website experienced relatively stable user numbers, with 'Simulated_Users' fluctuating between 9,257 and 15,635, and 'New_Simulated_Users' ranging from 5,575 to 9,776. However, as the COVID-19 measures took effect post-announcement, there was a notable decline in website visitors. 'Simulated_Users' dropped from 11,961 on 16th March 2020 to a low of 2,995 towards the end of the month. Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' decreased from a high of 6,538 following the March 15th announcement to lows of 1,516 towards the end of the month.\n",

This marked a 21-day containment period. The number of COVID-19 cases continued to rise, prompting additional measures, including an [extension of the curfew hours](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/covid-19-night-curfew-times-changed-to-9pm-4am-522814). The movement cessation in major counties and curfew persisted as the president announced their extension for a further 30 days on 6th June 2016.\n",

    "- Between the 1st and 7th of April 2020, daily 'Simulated_Users' exhibited fluctuations, reaching peaks of 4,529 users and troughs of 2,303, while 'New_Simulated_Users' ranged from 2,439 to 1,222. However, following the announcement of movement restrictions on the 8th of April 2020, the number of users continued to fluctuate, but there was a notable decline in 'Simulated_Users' on Jambojet's website. The figures plummeted from 1,271 to a minimum of 561 users per day in the latter part of the month. Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' experienced a decrease from 812 to a low of 322 users per day.\n",

    "- May recorded the lowest user traffic, with neither 'Simulated_Users' nor 'New_Simulated_Users' surpassing 1,000. 'Simulated_Users' fluctuated between highs of 914 and lows of 340, marking the lowest daily user count for the entire data period. Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' ranged from highs of 723 to lows of 248, also representing the lowest daily user count observed in our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- June continued to experience low traffic to Jambojet's website, consistently remaining below 1,000 daily users. However, there were brief periods of improvement, particularly as Kenyans anticipated the potential lifting of curfews and travel restrictions. Between the 3rd and 9th of June 2020, there was a minimal spike in traffic, with 'Simulated_Users' fluctuating from 2,232 to 1,198 and 'New_Simulated_Users' ranging from 2,053 to 896. A similar pattern occurred on the 29th and 30th of June, where 'Simulated_Users' reached 1,193 and 1,135 users, and 'New_Simulated_Users' hit 1,085 and 934 users, respectively.\n",

The cessation of movement into and out of Nairobi Metropolitan Area, Mombasa County, and Mandera County was lifted, providing significant relief for the affected regions. Additionally, local air travel was scheduled to resume from July 15 under the guidelines set by the Ministry of Health and Transport. In line with this, [Jambojet announced the resumption of its operations to 5 local destinations](https://www.jambojet.com/en-us/covid-19-updates/jambojet-to-resume-operations-to-local-destinations/). Moreover, [international flights were set to resume from August 1](https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2020-07-06-kenya-to-resume-international-flights-from-august-1/). This easing of restrictions, particularly the resumption of air travel, presented a positive outlook for Jambojet as web traffic began to steadily increase to expected levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Following the announcement on July 6, there was a remarkable upswing in traffic to Jambojet's website. 'Simulated_Users' increased substantially, rising from a range of 656 to 996 users between July 1st and 5th, 2020, to an impressive 5,050 users on July 6th, 2020. Similarly, 'New_Simulated_Users' witnessed a significant improvement, elevating from a range of 496 to 888 users from July 1st to 5th, 2020, to 4,514 users on July 6th, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The positive trend in user traffic continued, with another notable spike following the announcement on July 15th 2020 regarding the resumption of local air travel. Consequently, 'Simulated_Users' surged to 14,518, and 'New_Simulated_Users' reached 14,382. In the subsequent days and months, web traffic demonstrated sustained improvement, with no dips below 3,500 daily users and achieving a highs of up to 22,598 'Simulated_Users' and 17,105 'New_Simulated_Users'.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The impact of COVID-19 was again felt by the airline on 26th March 2021, following President Uhuru Kenyatta's directive to cease movement between major counties as a measure to curb the spread of the virus, [Jambojet declared the temporary suspension of operations from 29th March 2021 until further notice](https://www.jambojet.com/en-us/covid-19-updates/jambojet-operations-update-following-presidential-executive-order-on-covid-19/). This announcement triggered a notable spike in visits to the airline's website, as individuals sought to make travel arrangements before the implementation of the movement restrictions. On 26th March, the site experienced a surge with 37,380 'Simulated_Users' and 26,967 'Simulated_New_Users,' and on 27th March, 27,812 'Simulated_Users' and 16,875 'Simulated_New_Users' visited the site. However, this uptick was followed by a subsequent decline in website visitors, reflecting the broader impact of COVID-19 and the restrictions imposed on travel. The suspension of movement was later lifter on 1st May 2021."

This correlation also corresponds to broader travel patterns in the country. As the end of the month approaches, people tend to take leave from work, and schools close for the December holidays, boosting travel interest. The Autumn and Winter seasons, associated with increased tourism and travel, witness a surge in visits and bookings on Jambojet's website. Moreover, the Summer holiday, though less popular for international tourists compared to Winter, becomes an opportune time for Kenyans in the diaspora to return home. Additionally, students in British system schools take extended breaks during the Summer months, contributing to heightened travel activity during this season."
